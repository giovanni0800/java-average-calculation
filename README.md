## 📖️ About
<p>Here was a simple average calculation program that I made to remember some steps in the Java language and warm up to the Linux environment for creating new projects and remembering some aspects of Java using Eclipse IDE.</p>

<p>I used the JOptionPane lib and tested my memory with java syntax.</p>

<p>In this project I used my mother tongue (Portuguese), but in future projects, I intend to start using English to have greater interaction with whoever will follow the next software.</p>

## 🤝️ Business rules
<p>This project is used to calculate a student's final average and return the status (passed or failed) according to the grades. To carry out this return, the final average equal to or less than 5 is considered as a failing grade, and between 6 and 10, it is presented as an passing grade. The system only accepts grades with values ​​between 0 and 10. After entering grades 1 and 2, if the average between these 2 values ​​is below 6, you will be asked to enter grade 3 to replace the lowest grade and calculate a new average.</p>
